RSQuestHelper
=============

This project was created to help me figure out what quests I can currently do in RuneScape.

The list of quests contains only quests that I haven't already finished. This is because there is no open API to figure out what quests I've completed.

TODO:
This script searches up my username on the highscores to get my stats, then figures out what quests I have the stat requirements for. Then it dumps out the list of quests I can do, ordered by difficulty. This also outputs the list of quests I can't do, ordered by difficulty. The output of the quests I can't do also contains what skills I'm missing the requirements for (my level as well as required level)
